# Excel Inventory with photos of firewalls in a communications building
## by Alejandra Ramos de Vega
### This Excel was used by the company "Team f√ºr Technik" for the project in Germany "Allach Inventur der Brandschotts" ("Inventory of firewalls in Allach") at the request of the company ISS.

## Introduction
Fire barriers guarantee the safety of each individual room against fire, preventing the spread of smoke and fire and therefore keeping areas and escape routes clear.

Normally they are used for cables and pipes running through a building or construction.

The principle of functioning of these protections, is the use of a material that expands under high temperatures and in this way seals any gap that exists in the wall, in this way the transmission of fire can be avoided for 30 or 90 minutes depending on the material used (these specifications are marked with F30 and F90).
All the bulkheads must come identified with a label, where the manufacturer, the date of revision, the type of bulkhead, among other information is specified. Without this label the bulkhead is considered "not suitable".

## Methodology 
Para este proyecto se creo el siguiente [archivo de Excel](https://github.com/aledominique/Excel_Inventory/blob/main/Inventory%20of%20fire%20bulkheads.xlsm)

## Results
* In the VAFB-SLC launch site there are no rockets launched for heavy payload mass(greater than 10000).
* The highest success rate are for the ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO and VLEO orbits.

* We only have the orbit type PO and SSO in the launch site VAFB SLC 4E.

* We only have the orbit type LEO, ISS, GTO, VLEO and SO in the launch site KSC LC 39A.
* The site with the highest success rate is KSC LC-39A.

* The only booster version with the Payload between 5000 and 10000 kg are the FT and the B4
* The B4 booster version is the booster with the highest payload. 
* The booster with the highest success rate is the Booster F9 FT (Falcon 9 Full Thrust)
